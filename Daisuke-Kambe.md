  Daisuke Kanbe is an anime character in the series
"The Millionare Detective Balance: Unlimited"
Currently he is one of my favorite anime guys,but of course the
series is only had two episodes, 
so my opinion might change. </div> 
<div id="two">
<br><br>
Daisuke has been assained to the modern crime prevention task force in Japan <br> for a reason unknown at the moment.
He has a sister, Suzue Kanbe who sometimes assists him in detecteve work when asked.
One of the most noticables things about Daisuke is that he has money, a <em> <strong> LOT </strong> </em>
of it.It is said that he has an unlimited balance in his account (which would explain the name). 
He relies heavily on his money while doing dectective work, something that
Haru Kato, another main character,<strong> Hates</strong>.
